# Web-API-Builder
A website that helps you build an API easily
Work-In-Progress

Purpose: Idk, I just wanna be better and JS and CSS. This project is very unpractical (is that a word?)

Update: 14 April 5:05pm GMT+8:00
The project now works. You can now generate working Python servers. Currently both GET and POST requests are allowed.
Planning to add option to delete paths or return functions, and being able to connect responses to MongoDB databases.

To run the exported Python file:

`>> pip3 install flask`

`>> python3 server.py`
